## Using the plugin

The plugin creates the object `window.BackgroundGeolocation`.  See [API Documentation](docs) for details

## Example

```javascript

////
// As with all Cordova plugins, you must configure within an #deviceready callback.
//
function onDeviceReady() {
    // Get a reference to the plugin.
    var bgGeo = window.BackgroundGeolocation;
    

    //This callback will be executed every time a geolocation is recorded in the background.
    var callbackFn = function(location, taskId) {
        var coords = location.coords;
        var lat    = coords.latitude;
        var lng    = coords.longitude;
        console.log('- Location: ', JSON.stringify(location));
        
        // Must signal completion of your callbackFn.
        bgGeo.finish(taskId);
    };

    // This callback will be executed if a location-error occurs.  Eg: this will be called if user disables location-services.
    var failureFn = function(errorCode) {
        console.warn('- BackgroundGeoLocation error: ', errorCode);
    }

    // Listen to location events & errors.
    bgGeo.on('location', callbackFn, failureFn);

    // Fired whenever state changes from moving->stationary or vice-versa.
    bgGeo.on('motionchange', function(isMoving) {
      console.log('- onMotionChange: ', isMoving);
    });

    // BackgroundGeoLocation is highly configurable.
    bgGeo.configure({
        // Geolocation config
        desiredAccuracy: 0,
        distanceFilter: 10,
        stationaryRadius: 50,
        locationUpdateInterval: 1000,
        fastestLocationUpdateInterval: 5000,

        // Activity Recognition config
        activityType: 'AutomotiveNavigation',
        activityRecognitionInterval: 5000,
        stopTimeout: 5,

        // Application config
        debug: true,
        stopOnTerminate: false,
        startOnBoot: true,

        // HTTP / SQLite config
        url: 'http://posttestserver.com/post.php?dir=cordova-background-geolocation',
        method: 'POST',
        autoSync: true,
        maxDaysToPersist: 1,
        headers: {
            "X-FOO": "bar"
        },
        params: {
            "auth_token": "maybe_your_server_authenticates_via_token_YES?"
        }
    }, function(state) {
        // This callback is executed when the plugin is ready to use.
        console.log('BackgroundGeolocation ready: ', state);
        if (!state.enabled) {
            bgGeo.start();
        }
    });

    // The plugin is typically toggled with some button on your UI.
    function onToggleEnabled(value) {
        if (value) {
            bgGeo.start();
        } else {
            bgGeo.stop();
        }
    }
}

```

## Help!  It doesn't work!

Yes it does.  [See the Wiki](https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt/wiki)

- on iOS, background tracking won't be engaged until you travel about **2-3 city blocks**, so go for a walk or car-ride (or use the Simulator with ```Debug->Location->City Drive```)
- When in doubt, **nuke everything**:  First delete the app from your device (or simulator)

```
$ cordova plugin remove com.transistorsoft.cordova.background-geolocation
$ cordova plugin add git@github.com:transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt.git

$ cordova platform remove ios
$ cordova platform add ios
$ cordova build ios

```

## [Advanced Sample Application](https://github.com/christocracy/cordova-background-geolocation-SampleApp)

A fully-featured [SampleApp](https://github.com/christocracy/cordova-background-geolocation-SampleApp) is available in its own public repo.  After first cloning that repo, follow the installation instructions in the **README** there.  This SampleApp includes a settings-screen allowing you to quickly experiment with all the different settings available for each platform.

If you're using XCode, boot the SampleApp in the iOS Simulator and enable ```Debug->Location->Freeway Drive```.

## Simple Testing Server

A simple Node-based [web-application](https://github.com/transistorsoft/background-geolocation-console) with SQLite database is available for field-testing and performance analysis.  If you're familiar with Node, you can have this server up-and-running in about **one minute**.

## Behaviour

The plugin has features allowing you to control the behaviour of background-tracking, striking a balance between accuracy and battery-usage.  In stationary-mode, the plugin attempts to descrease its power usage and accuracy by setting up a circular stationary-region of configurable #stationaryRadius.  

iOS has a nice system  [Significant Changes API](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/CLLocationManager/CLLocationManager.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/CLLocationManager/startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges), which allows the os to suspend your app until a cell-tower change is detected (typically 2-3 city-block change) 

Android automatically detects when the device is moving so has no need for a stationary-geofence.

The plugin will execute your configured ```callback``` provided to the ```#configure(callback, config)``` method.  Both iOS & Android use a SQLite database to persist **every** recorded geolocation so you don't have to worry about persistence when no network is detected.  The plugin provides a Javascript API to fetch and destroy the records in the database.  In addition, the plugin has an optional HTTP layer allowing allowing you to automatically HTTP POST recorded geolocations to your server.

The function ```changePace(isMoving, success, failure)``` is provided to force the plugin to enter "moving" or "stationary" state.

## iOS

The plugin uses iOS Significant Changes API, and starts triggering your configured ```callback``` only when a cell-tower switch is detected (i.e. the device exits stationary radius). 

When the plugin detects the device has moved beyond its configured #stationaryRadius, it engages the native platform's geolocation system for aggressive monitoring according to the configured `#desiredAccuracy`, `#distanceFilter`.  The plugin attempts to intelligently scale `#distanceFilter` based upon the current reported speed.  Each time `#distanceFilter` is determined to have changed by 5m/s, it recalculates it by squaring the speed rounded-to-nearest-five and adding #distanceFilter (I arbitrarily came up with that formula.  Better ideas?).

  `(round(speed, 5))^2 + distanceFilter`

## Android

Using the [ActivityRecognition API](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/ActivityRecognitionApi.html) provided by [Google Play Services](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html), Android will constantly monitor [the nature](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/DetectedActivity.html) of the device's movement at a sampling-rate configured by `#activityRecognitionInterval`.  When the plugin sees a DetectedActivity of [STILL](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/DetectedActivity.html), location-updates will be halted -- when it sees `IN_VEHICLE, ON_BICYCLE, ON_FOOT, RUNNING, WALKING`, location-updates will be initiated.
