## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.1] - 2016-04-12
- [Added] ios logic to handle being launched in the background (by a background-fetch event, for example).  When launched in the background, iOS will essentially do a `changePace(true)` upon itself and let the stop-detection system determine engage stationary-mode as detected.
- [Changed] ios halt stop-detection distance was using `distanceFilter`; changed to use `stationaryRadius`.  This effects users using the accelerometer-based stop-detection system:  after stop is detected, the device must move `stationaryRadius` meters away from location where stop was detected.
- [Changed] When `maxRecordsToPersist == 0`, don't persist any record.
- [Added] Implement `startOnBoot` param for iOS.  iOS always ignored `startOnBoot`.  If you set `startOnBoot: false` now, iOS will not begin tracking when launched in background after device is rebooted (eg: from a background-fetch event, geofence exit or significant-change event)
- [Changed] Modified the method signature of `#configure`.  The config `{}` will now be the 1st param and the `callbackFn` will now signal successful configuration.  The `locationCallback` and `locationErrorCallback` must now be provided with a separate event-listener `#onLocation`.
- [Added] Imported Android demo code so that users can test the Android plugin using the SampleApp `bundle ID` and `license`

## [1.5.0] - 2016-04-04
- [Fixed] ios `stopOnTerminate` was defaulting to `false`.  Docs say default is `true`.
- [Fixed] ios `useSignificantChangesOnly` was broken.
- [Added] Add odometer to ios location JSON schema
- [Added] ios Log network reachability flags on connection-type changes.
- [Added] `maxRecordsToPersist`
in plugin's SQLite database.
- [Added] API methods `#addGeofences` (for adding a list-of-geofences), `#removeGeofences`
- [Changed] The plugin will no longer delete geofences when `#stop` is called; it will merely stop monitoring them.  When the plugin is `#start`ed again, it will start monitoringt any geofences it holds in memory.  To completely delete geofences, use new method `#removeGeofences`.
- [Fixed] iOS battery `is_charging` was rendering as `1/0` instead of boolean `true/false`
- 
## [1.4.1] - 2016-03-20
- [Fixed] iOS Issue with timers not running on main-thread.
- [Fixed] iOS Issue with acquriring stationary-location on a stale location.  Ensure the selected stationary-location is no older than 1s.
- [Fixed] iOS Removed some log messages appearing when `{debug: false}`

## [1.4.0] - 2016-03-08

## [1.3.0]

- [Changed] Upgrade `emailLog` method to attach log as email-attachment rather than rendering to email-body.  The result of `#getState` is now rendered to the 

##0.6.4

- Tweak stop-detection system.  add `#stopDetectionDelay`

## 0.6.3
- Introduce accelerometer-base stop-detection for ios.
- `@config {Boolean} useSignificantChangesOnly`
- When a geofence event occurs, the associated location will have geolocation meta-data attached to the associated location.  Find it in the POST data.  See Wiki Location Data Schema for details.
